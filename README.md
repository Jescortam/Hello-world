# Hello-world
This is my second time using GitHub, hoping this time I actually make it.
Actually, this guide just told me to describe myself or something like that idk: My name is Jesus and I am 17 years old (I hope someday I look back and see myself but younger and more stupid... Is "stupidier" a word?).
